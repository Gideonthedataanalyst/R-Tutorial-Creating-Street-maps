# R-Tutorial-Creating-Street-maps

🌍✨ Just completed a fascinating R project where I created a street map of Mombasa, Kenya, using OpenStreetMap data! Leveraging the power of the {osmdata} and {sf} packages, I mapped out Mombasa's vibrant street network and coastline details, bringing the city’s unique layout to life.

With this map, I was able to capture Mombasa's dynamic mix of urban streets and coastal charm in R. Thanks to tutorials like Prof. Paul Christiansen’s, I navigated through data tidying and layering, refining the map for clarity and aesthetic.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) data paired with R’s mapping capabilities truly makes it possible to create valuable visualizations for urban planning, tourism, or business insights right at our fingertips. Proud of this project and excited for more mapping adventures to come!
